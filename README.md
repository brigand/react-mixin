Want to use ES6/CoffeeScript/TypeScript/{InsertNoun}Script classes, and mixins?

React doesn't have anything built in for this, but don't worry!  This package implements
react's mixin strategy for arbitrary objects.

Install with one of:

```sh
# recommended
npm install --save react-mixin@2

# will expose window.reactMixin or the reactMixin AMD module
curl 'wzrd.in/standalone/react-mixin@2' > vendor/react-mixin.js
```


Here's an example:

```js
var reactMixin = require('react-mixin');
var someMixin = require('some-mixin');
class Foo extends React.Component {
    render: function(){ return <div /> }    
}
reactMixin(Foo.prototype, someMixin);
reactMixin(Foo.prototype, someOtherMixin);
```

## Class level behavior

Many of the things that were regular properties in createClass are now static properties of the class.  To have things like getDefaultProps, propTypes, and getInitialState working correctly you need to apply react-mixin a level higher than the prototype: the class itself.

```js
var mixin = {
  getDefaultProps: function(){
    return {b: 2};
  }
};

class Foo {
  static defaultProps = {
    a: 1
  };
  render(){
    console.log(this.props); // {a: 1, b: 2}
  }
}

reactMixin.onClass(Foo, mixin);
```

## But it's at the end of the file!

For more readability, there is an es7 decorator proposal.  With the latest babel version and the stage config option set to 0 or 1, you can use decorators.

> Note: this creates a wrapper around the component instead of directly mutating it.

```js
@reactMixin.decorate(mixin)
class Foo {
  static defa...
}
```

This is a very thin wrapper.

```js
  reactMixin.decorate = function(mixin) {
    return function(reactClass) {
      return reactMixin.onClass(reactClass, mixin);
    };
  }
```

## And more

Method `mixin` is a decorator for many mixins. It will be save `displayName` for your component.

```js
// Real world example

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { mixin as Mixin } from 'react-mixin';
import { Navigate } from 'react-router';
import { LogMixins } from 'private-logger';

@Mixin(Navigate, LogMixins)
export default class SearchComponent extends Component {
  onChange() {
    this.say('Start search:', this.state.query); // Method from private-logger.LogMixins
    this.transitionTo('search', { query: this.state.query }); // Method from react-router.Navigate
  }
  render() {
    // return component code
  }
}
```

## Differences from createClass

@ndout resolved the differences by adding `reactMixin.onClass`.  If there are any more incompatibilites, **other than autobinding methods which is intentionally omitted**, please create an issue.

---

That's pretty much it.  You get errors instead of silently overwriting things, like in react,
with the exception of things whitelisted in index.js as type MANY, MANY_MERGED (getDefaultProps/getInitialState).

Autobinding is done by React.createClass, and there's no equivilent in ES6 classes.  This also has better performance (I think), but you do lose some convenience.  You can explicitly bind things in the constructor or componentWillMount.  On the main class, the constructor replaces componentWillMount.

```js
class Foo extends React.Component {
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }
    ...
}
```

## But... autobinding!

If you need autobinding because a mixin depends on it, you can bind the needed methods in the constructor, or do something like this (haven't given it much thought, suggestions welcome).

```js
function autobind(methodNames){
    return {
        componentWillMount: function(){
            methodNames.forEach((name) => {
                this[name] = this[name].bind(this);
            });
        }
    };
}

@reactMixin.decorate(mixin)
@reactMixin.decorate(autobind(Object.keys(mixin)))
class Foo {
  ...
}
```

Like this but want to use it outside of react?  See [smart-mixin][1] and define your own mixin spec.

## Should I use this?

I can't think of a more elegant solution to mixins in es6 classes.  If someone comes up with one, create an issue
and I'll link to it here.

In the future people will likely use [high order components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750) instead of mixins, making this library obsolete. 

Should you use es6 classes for react components?  Based on the hacks required above, I'd probably avoid it.
It's important that react makes it an option, and it's important to be able to use mixins with them, which
is why this library exists.

`createClass` isn't going anywhere.
